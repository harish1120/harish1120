# Hi, I'm Harish 👋

**AI/ML Engineer** bridging the gap between research and production.

I'm a published researcher and applied ML engineer specializing in production-grade GenAI and LLM-powered applications — from RAG pipelines and prompt engineering to scalable end-to-end systems. I care about building things that actually ship: reliable, maintainable, and well-documented.

📍 Ontario, Canada · 🎓 MSc in Electrical & Computer Engineering (Deep Learning & Computer Vision), Lakehead University
